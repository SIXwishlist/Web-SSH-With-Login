This project is a web based SSH client written in PHP. 
It is simple to configure all you need to do is change the $USER/$USERNAME and the $PASSWORD variables in the terminal and deploy all the files to your web server. 
You can also change the home directory where the terminal executes in.

The Web SSH Terminal is based on this one with modifications: https://github.com/nickola/web-console
